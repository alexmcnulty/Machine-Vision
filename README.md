## Mixture of Gaussians
This folder contains implementation of mixture of gaussians using both gaussian and t distribution approaches.

## Classification of apples
Given uncopyrighted images of apples with corresopnding masked images (on the apples), a mixture of gaussians model is trained to classify apples in test images not seen during training.

* Images of the apples and masks used can be found in the corresponding folders above.

# Homographies and Tracking

## Part A-D
The aim of practical 1 is to calculate the homography that best maps two sets of points to one another. This is used for creating panoramas, and for calculating the 3d pose of planes.

## Part E-F
Condensation is actually Factored Sampling, but applied iteratively to a sequence of observations, and incorporating a motion model. So here, time will essentially stand still: given a SINGLE set of "observations", estimate the posterior probabilities. Observations will be simulated: The real 2D distribution we would like to estimate is the red channel of an abstract image (provided). 

Also in practical9b the given shape (template) will be tracked as it moves in a sequence of frames.

## Part G-H
Combines Tracking and Homogrpahies. Track the four corners of a square cut out and project a cube on top as the camera moves through the frames.
